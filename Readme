For testing association, I will have to check if the last generater QR code is
available and it is receiving the repsonse from the backend server

Testing Connectivity
-------------------
1) If QRUid is NULL, in that case I have to return false
2) For MVP, making a call to the backend for the connection,

To be added checks
--> The encryption, decryption is working fine, by generating a hello - world message


Internal Working
---------------

How the data will be received, does encryption etc will be taken care of ?
All the data will be long polling request by chrome extension,

Check how the android phone, will be connecting to the backend ?


MVP Features
------------
1) Work on features connecting extension to backend
 a) how it should connect to the backend, and when it should connect


2) If its connected
  ----> Check for the url in the database
      ----> url Present : backend returns them
      ----> url not there, it asks for generated password, and sends them to the backend
3) If its not connected
  ---> I am going to implement this feature now,
  ---> It will generate the QR code
  ---> It will show the QR code in the popuup
  ---> The phone will scans the QR code, and try to make a request again

  Techincalities
  --------------
    ---> After QR code being generated, extension has to register
    ---> to the backend for that uid
    ---> extension will make a request to the backend saying register me on the endpoint
    ---> Spring-boot will add an entry corresponding to that uid,
    ---> Spring boot will wait for 3 seconds for the response in the database
        ---> If there is no data in the databse for 3 seconds, it will send the response
        ---> unable to reach the phone, and the browser will make a request again after
        ---> spring boot will again wait for 3 second for the request.
        ---> finally the extension will stop makaing the request after total wait time of 6 seconds,
        after that the extension will show the button of reload.

  ---> Logic to be implemented in backend, spring makes an entry in the redis saying
  uid ---> browser
  uid ---> mobile

  After receiving request from the browser, it will check for the entry in the redis
  about the particular field, and it will see if there is an entry, it will return conncted
