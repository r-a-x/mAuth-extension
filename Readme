For testing association, I will have to check if the last generater QR code is
available and it is receiving the repsonse from the backend server

Testing Connectivity
-------------------
1) If QRUid is NULL, in that case I have to return false
2) For MVP, making a call to the backend for the connection,

To be added checks
--> The encryption, decryption is working fine, by generating a hello - world message


Internal Working
---------------

How the data will be received, does encryption etc will be taken care of ?
All the data will be long polling request by chrome extension,


MVP Features
------------
1) ---> No encryption, its a long process in itself
